## If you are wondering, why suddenly 30days challenge?

I'm taking part in the ITSNP 30-day challenge. In this 30 days, I'm going to be focused on CSS. CSS has never felt like my cup of tea, so I've avoided it, but now I'm interested in learning more about it. And this time, with the support of ITSNP and the Askmitra community, I think I'll have more confidence in my abilities. During this 30 days of learning, I am curious to learn and explore anything relating to CSS, plus possibly a little JS. This is already exciting.  I advise everyone to begin this journey with whatever interests you.
