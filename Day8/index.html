        <h2>What is CLG?</h2>
        <p>
            30 days of self guided learning is an initiative by ITSNP ORG to help women tech enthusiast connect and learn new 
            skills daily for 30 days for at least an hour a day while connecting and creating projects together with future 
            women leaders. The main reason of CLG is to make peer-inspiration more efficient, We believe a women can guide, 
            inspire another women for good, The learning can be any new skills like coding, personality development, designing, 
            etc., or even enhancing the existing skills you have. The sole goal here is to learn and to form the habit of 
            learning while making your commitment public to make it more consistent. This learning pattern will help you in 
            three main aspects: Consistency , Peer-Inspiration, and Development.
